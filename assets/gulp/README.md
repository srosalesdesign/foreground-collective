# Scratch Theme for WordPress + ACF

## Gulp.js

You should only need to edit [`gulpfile.js`](https://github.com/zackphilipps/scratch-theme/blob/master/assets/gulp/gulpfile.js) here.

Run `npm install` in this directory from your command line to install all of the Node packages. Once that's done, you can run `gulp` from the same directory to begin your automated workflow.
