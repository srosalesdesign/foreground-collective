## Welcome!

Scratch is the world's first [Advanced Custom Fields](http://advancedcustomfields.com)-ready WordPress theme. It's not so much a theme as a springboard for building your own fully custom WordPress themes.

Scratch starts with the [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate). Then, we add our custom SCSS and JS frameworks. After that, our custom `Gruntfile` and `gulpfile`. Finally, we add our bare-bones template files and `scratch.php`, a very small file that packs a punch.

### Can I use Scratch outside of WordPress?

Sure! Simply strip out all of the PHP and work from the `index.html` file.

## Features

### Forked from HTML5 Boilerplate

Enjoy all of the benefits of the best mobile-first framework out there. Plus, we regularly pull H5BP updates down to Scratch, so you never have to worry about Scratch falling behind.

New to HTML5 Boilerplate? [Read the docs here.](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/dist/doc/TOC.md)

### Completely ACF-ready!

Scratch is the only WordPress theme out there that is locked & loaded for [Advanced Custom Fields](http://advancedcustomfields.com). Enjoy:

- Enqueueing of scripts and styles for [ACF Google Maps](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/google-map/) field
- Declaration of Header, Sidebar, and Footer Options pages
- Inclusion of `acf-json/` directory with `index.php`
- [Layouts](/acf.html#layouts-page-template) field group & page template
- Front end styles for `acf_form()`

### CSS on Steroids

Scratch is built on [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/), the popular CSS preprocessor. Our SCSS framework includes:

- The [CSS grid from Bones](/css.html#grid-system)
- [Ionicons](/css.html#ionicons-overview), the icon font
- An awesome [mixin library](/css.html#mixins)
- Beautiful default colors, courtesy of [clrs.cc](http://clrs.cc/)
- Placeholder files that marry perfectly with WordPress, including a custom login stylesheet

### Only the Best JS

The JavaScript we include is "the best" because it fits in with the WordPress philosophy â€“ **flexible, extendable, and customizable.** Quickly research the following tools and you'll find that they are extremely valuable.

- [Glide.js](/javascript.html#sliders-via-glidejs), the slider
- [Magnific Popup](/javascript.html#modals-via-magnific-popup)
- [Velocity.js](/javascript.html#animations-with-velocityjs) for high-performance animations
- [jQuery Waypoints](/javascript.html#jquery-waypoints)

### Custom Automated Workflow

Too many plugins? Site running slow? With Scratch, you serve **one stylesheet** and **one script file**.

Cross-browser compatibility issues? With Scratch, you can write CSS according to the W3 spec and **vendor prefixes are automatically added.**

- SCSS compiling & minification
- [Automatic CSS vendor-prefixing](/css.html#autoprefixer)
- JS concatenation & minification
- Images are [automatically optimized on upload](https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin)
- Save a file, and watch your site instantly refresh across all browsers & devices via [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/)

### The List (of WordPress plugins)

Once you activate Scratch, you'll be asked to install & activate a few plugins. Install all, any, or none of them with a few clicks.

This list may change, but for now, Scratch recommends:

- [Advanced Custom Fields Pro (premium)](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/)
- [ACF-Content Analysis for Yoast SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/acf-content-analysis-for-yoast-seo)
- [Resize Image After Upload](https://wordpress.org/plugins/resize-image-after-upload/screenshots/)
- [WordPress SEO by Yoast](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/)

### Clean, minimal PHP

Jump in to your template files and find everything you need, and nothing you don't.

Improve the functionality of WordPress with Scratch. Get acquainted with [Layout Functions](/acf.html#using-scratchs-layout-functions), the cherry on top of WordPress as a CMS + a CSS grid. Other goodies:

- Hide the WordPress admin toolbar from the front-end
- The [Bones](http://themble.com/bones/) "head cleanup" function
